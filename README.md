# Mediblob

Demo Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ipWNKoLJ-U

**Mediblob** is a modern medical portal that connects **patients and doctors**. It lets patients track their health in real time (symptoms, medications, appointments) while doctors monitor everything on a dashboard and can manage care plans

I made the project with Nextjs, Typescript, Javascript, Tailwind, MongoDB.

Something I struggled with while creating this project was to create different access levels, since I haven't done that before, and I've been able to complete it, though.
